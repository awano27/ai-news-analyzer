The emerging frontier is agentic coding : AI systems capable of planning changes, executing them across multiple steps and iterating based on feedback. Yet despite the excitement around “AI agents that code,” most enterprise deployments underperform. The limiting factor is no longer the model. It’s context : The structure, history and intent surrounding the code being changed. In other words, enterprises are now facing a systems ",
